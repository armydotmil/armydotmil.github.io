            <h3>Support guidance from Microsoft</h3>
            <div class="browser-logo ie-logo"><img alt="logo" src="/e2/images/rv7/upgrade/ie.png"></div>
            <p>Beginning January 12, 2016, only the current version of Internet Explorer available for a supported operating system will receive technical support and security updates. Microsoft recommends that customers running older versions of Internet Explorer upgrade to the most recent version, which is Internet Explorer 11 on Windows 7, Windows 8.1, and Windows 10.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Benefits of upgrading</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Security</b>- Hacks, viruses, malware and other malicious security issues constantly evolve, and only browsers that evolve with modern preventative measures will be able to keep up. By opening yourself up to security risks, it not only effects you but can cause problems for the entire network you are connected to.</li>
            <li><b>Modern web technology</b>- HTML5, CSS3, and WebGL are examples of technology used in modern browsers. Without support for these current, and future, technologies web pages utilizing them may look strange or even broken.</li>
            <li><b>Speed</b>- Image rendering, network optimization, caching and many other factors play a role in how fast a page loads. </li>
            <li><b>Features</b>- New ways of organizing links and bookmarks, web monitoring tools, customization of allowed technologies, and many other features are only found on newer browsers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Ok, I’m convinced, now how do I upgrade?</h2>
        <h3>Install a new browser</h3>
        <p>In many cases you can simply download and install a new browser, and start using it right away. Be careful that you only download a new browser from an official source. If you do not have permission to install new programs on your computer, ask your network administrator to help. They should be able to install the browser of your choice or one from their own approved list.</p>
        <p>Take a look at the list of modern browsers below. Each link will have information about the browser and how to download it, so you can research and compare which works best for you.</p>

        <h3>Automatically Update</h3>
        <p>Within the Windows operating system there is an option to automatically update to the latest version. It can be found in the <b>Control Panel</b>, under <b>Windows Update</b>, and is possible to enable after clicking on <b>Check for Updates</b>. This option can be disabled by a network administrator as well, so be sure to contact them for assistance, if this is the case.</p>
